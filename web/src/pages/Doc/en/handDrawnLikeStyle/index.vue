    <blockquote>
      <p>Regarding fees</p>
      <p>
        Mind map is an open-source project under the MIT protocol. In theory, as
        long as the copyright statement of mind map is retained, there is no
        charge for commercial use, and this protocol will not be changed in the
        future. Moreover, neither the online version nor the client will
        consider charging. However, in order to ensure the sustainable
        development of the project, revenue will be obtained through various
        means, such as existing sponsorship methods. The second approach is to
        use paid plugins, with the basic principle that basic functions, core
        functions, and necessary functions are not charged, while optional
        additional functions may be charged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the fee is only applicable to developers. If it is only the
        online version or client version of the mind map, users do not need to
        pay, and all functions can be used for free.
      </p>

      HandDrawnLikeStyle is the first paid plugin that provides a hand drawn
      style, where the connections and shapes of nodes become hand drawn, just
      like the following:
    </p>
    <img src="../../../../assets/img/docs/手绘风格.png" style="width: 800px" />
    <p>
      You can also try to turn on the hand drawn style in the online version
      through the settings of 【 Basic Style 】 - 【 Enable Hand drawn Style 】.
    </p>
    <p>
      The internal implementation is through the
      <a href="https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough">rough</a> library, so if
      you have the energy, you can also implement this plugin based on this
      library yourself.
    </p>
    <h2>Charge</h2>
    <p>
      At present, the charging method is relatively primitive. By scanning the
      code and transferring money, please note the plugin you want to purchase
      and your email address, and then the plugin file will be sent to your
      email. Purchase should be made after full use and consideration. If you
      are not familiar with front-end development and do not know how to use
      plugins, please consider purchasing carefully. There will be no refund
      unless there are special reasons. If you find bugs or have requirements,
      you can submit relevant issues.

<span class="hljs-comment">// or import HandDrawnLikeStyle from &#x27;handDrawnLikeStyle.esm.min.js&#x27;</span>

MindMap.usePlugin(HandDrawnLikeStyle)
</code></pre>
    <p>2.Referencing Unpackaged Source Code</p>
    <p>You can first enter the plugin directory to execute:</p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>npm link
</code></pre>
    <p>Then enter your project root directory to execute:</p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>npm link simple-mind-plugin-handdrawnlikestyle
</code></pre>
    <p>Then you can directly import it for use:</p>
    <pre
      class="hljs"
    ><code><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> MindMap <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;simple-mind&#x27;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> HandDrawnLikeStyle <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;simple-mind-plugin-handdrawnlikestyle&#x27;</span>

MindMap.usePlugin(HandDrawnLikeStyle)
</code></pre>
    <p>
      After registration and instantiation of <code>MindMap</code>, the instance
      can be obtained through <code>mindMap.handDrawnLikeStyle</code>.
    </p>

      After registering the plugin, there is no need to perform other methods
      and the hand drawn style can take effect.

    <p>
      If you are using the mindMap.addPlugin method to dynamically register a
      component, you need to call the method of re rendering once:
    </p>
    <pre class="hljs"><code>mindMap.addPlugin(HandDrawnLikeStyle)
mindMap.reRender()
</code></pre>
